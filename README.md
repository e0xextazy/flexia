Torch Components is an open-source high-level API above the PyTorch framework. It provides functionality, which can be easily inserted into any PyTorch training and validation scripts.

### Installation
Information about how to install Torch Components.


### Callbacks
- Early Stopping is a simple method of regularization used to avoid overfitting during training Machine Learning models by stopping the training when the monitored value has not been improved.

- Model Checkpoint saves the model's weights (optimizer's state, and scheduler's state) when the monitored value has been improved.

- Timer stops training when the duration of the training stage reaches a certain limit of time. It is useful when you are using time-limit sources, e.g. Google Colab or Kaggle Kernels/Notebooks.


### Monitors
- CSV Monitor keeps all monitored values as Pandas DataFrame, which is asynchronously updated when new values are coming.
- Graphic Monitor plots diagram from collected values.


### Examples
