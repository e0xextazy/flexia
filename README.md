Flexia (Flexible Artificial Intelligence) is an open-source library, which provides high-level functionality for developing accurate Deep Learning models. There is a variety of methods for controlling (e.g Early Stopping, Model Checkpointing, Timing, etc.) and monitoring (e.g Weights & Biases, Print, Logging, and Taqadum) training, validation, and inferencing loops respectively.

API interface is designed from HuggingFace Transformers, and PyTorch Lightning frameworks, so the users, who already used one of them can faster adapt to Flexia's API.


# Installation

Installation is the first step for using any library. Flexia offers you many ways to do it depending on your setup. 

### PyPi (pip)

```py
pip install flexia 
```

### Google Colab

```
!git clone https://github.com/vad13irt/flexia.git
```

```py
import sys
sys.path.append("./flexia")
import flexia
```

### Kaggle Kernels



# Getting Started

# Examples

In order to speed up learning Flexia's API, we offer you to look at some examples. The examples cover most Deep Learning tasks such as Classification, Regression, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, and Learning to Rank.

# Contribution

Flexia is always open to your contributions! However, your contributions are required to have clean and readable code, thorough testing, and well-described documentation.
